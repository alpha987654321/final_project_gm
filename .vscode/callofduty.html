                Warzone is the second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, following the "Blackout" mode of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018). ‘‘Warzone’’ differs from Black Ops 4 by reducing reliance on equipable gadgets and instead encouraging the accumulation of a new in-game currency called Cash.[7] At launch, Warzone features two primary game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder,.[7] It supports up to 150 players in a single match, which exceeds the typical size of 100 players seen in other battle royale titles.[8] Some limited-time modes support 200 players.

                    <p>Call of Duty: Warzone[b] is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. The game is a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War and 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard, but does not require purchase of any of the aforementioned titles, and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content. Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software (the latter later credited as the sole developer following the integration of Cold War's content) and published by Activision.[1] Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between the three aforementioned titles.</p>

                    <p>At launch, the game features two main modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system that can be used at "Buy Stations" in and around the map. "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes (which were shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes prior to Season 6, v1.29, but now are unique to Warzone). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks. Cash can be found by looting buildings and killing players that have cash on them. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players. However, in free post-launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.[2][3]

                        The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. In April 2021, Activision announced that Warzone had surpassed 100 million active players.[4] A sequel, titled Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0, was released on November 16, 2022, as a free-to-play component of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, while a mobile version of Warzone is also in development.</p>
